From my point of view, Indexation should be know by everyone who is planning and developing a database. Indexes gives us a better performance for our database and queries which are important for you, and needs to be optimized. By defining indexes, we are creating new index table which has references to original data table, or could include data directly in it, as we have done in our case. Of course, we cannot make everything an index ! After changing table data or changed columns, SQL will perform an index rebuild ! We need to know that rebuild = time. So, we need to make sure that we have enough indexes to make database faster and not many to make it work slower due the indexes rebuild. Indexes are key factor for performance, once you have a good database architecture. 


Also I would say that MSSQL Execution Plan is a very very useful feature for SSMS. It shows us every steps what SQL is doing in order to give you an result. Execution Plan gives you imagination on what happens behind the query. Using this tool we can optimize our queries and indexes.
